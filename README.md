# Sorting Visualizer
*An HTML/JS site that visualizes different sorting algorithms*<br>
*This visualizer was inspired by [Radu's Visualizer with Sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AwSlHlpFuc)*<br>
*Click [here](https://kalani-kawaguchi.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer/) for the deployed site of the project*<br>
<br>
Currently only bubble sort is implemented.<br>
<br>
On loading the page an array of 100 values ranging from 1 to 100 is created and represented by bars on the screen.<br>
Values being compared are represented as two **orange** highlighted bars. When a swap occurs the two values are represented as two **red** highlighted bars.<br>
There are two buttons **Generate** and **Sort**<br>
<br>
**Generate**: Will load a new array of 100 values with random integers from 1 to 100<br>
**Sort**: Will call on the bubble sort function to visualize the algorithm. The speed of the animation can be scaled.<br>
<br>
## To-Do:
- Add noise
  - Fix the oscillator noise
- Add more sorting algorithms
  - Quick sort
  - Heap sort
  - Insertion Sort
